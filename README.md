## Titanic Data Analysis

The Titanic Data Analysis project aims to explore and understand the demographics and survival rates of passengers aboard the Titanic.
Here's a project description for your Titanic Data Analysis:By using the Titanic dataset, the project focuses on cleaning the data, handling missing values, and generating a comprehensive profile report to uncover insights and patterns. This analysis provides a foundation for further predictive modeling and statistical analysis.

The project includes the following key steps:

1. **Loading Data**: Reading the Titanic dataset from a CSV file.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Identifying and replacing missing values with a placeholder to ensure data integrity.
3. **Profile Reporting**: Utilizing `ydata-profiling` to generate an extensive profile report, highlighting the dataset's structure and key statistics.
4. **Missing Values Summary**: Creating a summary report of missing values for reference.

# Titanic Data Analysis

## Introduction

This project involves analyzing the Titanic dataset to understand the demographics and survival rates of the passengers. The dataset is cleaned, missing values are handled, and an extensive profile report is generated using `ydata-profiling`. The goal is to provide insights into the dataset and prepare it for further analysis.

## Project Structure

- `titanic.csv`: The raw Titanic dataset.
- `titanic_cleaned.csv`: The cleaned dataset with missing values handled.
- `titanic.html`: The profile report generated from the cleaned dataset.
- `missing_values_summary.txt`: A summary of missing values in the dataset.
- `main.py`: The main script for loading, cleaning, and profiling the dataset.

## Features

- Load the Titanic dataset.
- Clean the dataset by replacing missing values.
- Generate a profile report using `ydata-profiling`.
- Save a summary of missing values.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/BHARAT_INTERN_DS_02.git
    ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd titanic-data-analysis
    ```

3. Create a virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    ```

4. Activate the virtual environment:

    - On Windows:
      ```bash
      .\env\Scripts\activate
      ```
    - On macOS/Linux:
      ```bash
      source env/bin/activate
      ```

5. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

1. Ensure your dataset is located at the specified path in `main.py`.
2. Run the script:
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```
3. After running the script, the following files will be generated:
    - `titanic.html`: Profile report of the Titanic dataset.
    - `missing_values_summary.txt`: Summary of missing values.

## Example Output

### Original DataFrame

```
   PassengerId  Survived  Pclass  ... Cabin Embarked
0            1         0       3  ...   NaN        S
1            2         1       1  ...   C85        C
2            3         1       3  ...   NaN        S
3            4         1       1  ...  C123        S
4            5         0       3  ...   NaN        S
```

### Cleaned DataFrame

```
   PassengerId  Survived  Pclass  ...         Cabin Embarked
0            1         0       3  ...  Not Available        S
1            2         1       1  ...            C85        C
2            3         1       3  ...  Not Available        S
3            4         1       1  ...           C123        S
4            5         0       3  ...  Not Available        S
```

## Detailed Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Missing values in the dataset are identified and replaced with a placeholder ("Not Available").
- **Profile Report**: An extensive profile report is generated using `ydata-profiling`, providing insights into the dataset's structure and content.
- **Missing Values Summary**: A summary of missing values in each column is saved to a text file for reference.

## Lessons Learned

Throughout this project, several key lessons were learned:
- The importance of data cleaning and handling missing values.
- Utilizing profiling tools to gain insights into datasets.
- Efficiently generating reports to summarize data characteristics.

## Optimizations

- The cleaning process could be optimized by applying more sophisticated imputation techniques.
- The profile report generation could be configured to exclude less relevant sections to reduce processing time.
